# Sign Language Translation App with IoT and AI Integration

A mobile application that translates sign language into spoken English in real-time using smartphone cameras. Designed for deaf and hard-of-hearing users, the app recognizes hand gestures and converts them instantly into text or speech.

## Abstract

This project develops a mobile app that translates sign language into spoken English in real-time using smartphone cameras. Designed for deaf and hard-of-hearing users, the app recognizes hand gestures and converts them instantly into text or speech, enabling smoother daily communication without needing human interpreters. Unlike existing solutions that require special equipment, our portable system works anywhere using just a phone. Initial tests show accurate translation for common signs, with potential applications in healthcare, education, and public services. By providing an accessible, affordable communication tool, this technology helps bridge the gap between deaf and hearing communities, promoting greater social inclusion. Future updates may add two-way translation and support for regional sign variations.
